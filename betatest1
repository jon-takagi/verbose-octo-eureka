DESCRIPTION
===========
Give a brief description of what the game is about/like.
A couple sentences will suffice.

It's Pacman, but in an asteroids engine.


IMPRESSIONS
===========
Overall, how did you find the game? Did it seem to work well?
Was it fun to play?

Game worked well-ish. About as fun as pacman on a laptop will be (except for some small bugs)

USABILITY
=========
Below, list any issues where you weren't able to understand what to
do, what was going on, or how to make something happen. For example,
if a command is missing from the help menu or doesnâ€™t work as you
expected, explain that here.

Window does not automatically take focus from the command line. You have
to click on the window after it opens, and the game is not paused during
this time

ERRORS
======
Below list any errors (meaning actual error messages) that you found
while testing. You don't have to look at the code at all or find out
what's causing them, but list all the information you can that will
help the programmer find it. (For example, list the actual error type
given and the line/file that the error is pointing to. Explain in as
much detail as possible what you were doing that caused the error.)

Hitting the edge of the screen causes the game to crash, throwing a
IndexError - the array isn't wrapping correctly. Using arr[x % len(arr)] will
prevent this. The error is on line 150.


MISBEHAVIORS
============
Below, list any misbehaviors you found while testing. By
"misbehavior" we mean something that didn't cause an error message, but
nevertheless seemed to do the wrong thing. An item in your inventory
disappearing for no reason would be a good example. Again, write
exactly what you were doing that caused the problem.

When turning up and down, the player is occasionally taken across the path and
not allowed to turn. This is because the code that automatically corrects for
small differences in the player's alignment has bugs. It is intended to allow
the player to turn at approximately the correct time.

DIFFICULTY
==========
Was the difficulty of the game reasonable? It should be somewhat
challenging to be fun, but also not hopeless.

The maps are very linear, and not being able to wrap makes it more difficult.
Creating maps more like the original - with lots of twists and turns, and many
more intersections will make the game more interesting

SUGGESTIONS
===========
Do you have any suggestions for the game's programmer(s)?
