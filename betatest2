DESCRIPTION
===========
Give a brief description of what the game is about/like.
A couple sentences will suffice.

Asteroids but PvP. Very laggy

IMPRESSIONS
===========
Overall, how did you find the game? Did it seem to work well?
Was it fun to play?

Fun to play, but very laggy. Collisions worked as expected,
missiles did not. Knowing Rob, he called them "miss"-iles and
designed them to always miss.

USABILITY
=========
Below, list any issues where you weren't able to understand what to
do, what was going on, or how to make something happen. For example,
if a command is missing from the help menu or doesnâ€™t work as you
expected, explain that here.

Controls were intuitive, but an energy meter would be useful

ERRORS
======
Below list any errors (meaning actual error messages) that you found
while testing. You don't have to look at the code at all or find out
what's causing them, but list all the information you can that will
help the programmer find it. (For example, list the actual error type
given and the line/file that the error is pointing to. Explain in as
much detail as possible what you were doing that caused the error.)

N/A

MISBEHAVIORS
============
Below, list any misbehaviors you found while testing. By
"misbehavior" we mean something that didn't cause an error message, but
nevertheless seemed to do the wrong thing. An item in your inventory
disappearing for no reason would be a good example. Again, write
exactly what you were doing that caused the problem.

Missiles never hit anything.

DIFFICULTY
==========
Was the difficulty of the game reasonable? It should be somewhat
challenging to be fun, but also not hopeless.

Yes, very reasonable. Asteroid volume has been tuned correctly to not make
everyone die of asteroids

SUGGESTIONS
===========
Do you have any suggestions for the game's programmer(s)?
fix the lag
